            <h2 class="test">About Me</h2>
            <p>A San Francisco Native, I built a career in business development, customer service, sales, and managed multiple 
              business units.  Through all my accomplishments, I find myself searching to build and create products.  Tech has 
              been an interest of mine for many years but with growing my own business finding the time was difficult. In 2019, 
              I found the opportunity to put together a project to learn how to develop a platforn for insurance agents.  I strive
             to be effecient in my work.  Definition of crazy - "Doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results". 
             The skills I've acquired in my career is good for Project/Program Management and Product Management. Fyform allowed me learn
             how software is developed from an idea all the way to deployment. Being the non-technical co-founder to becoming the technical co-founder has
             given me great appreciation for all the products that have been built before.</p>

                  <h5>Background</h5>
                  <p>Fyform is a SaaS insurance workflow tool that not only helps you fill out applications, 
                    send applications direct to MGA, retrieves the correct forms for each line of business, 
                    and organizes all relevant client documents, it also performs commission calculations on 
                    every policy sold. This helps save massive amounts of time and effort usually spent on retrieving 
                    old files and repeatedly filling out the same information, so the agent can  focus on selling.</p>
                  <h5>Technology</h5>
                  <p>Ruby on Rails  was chosen as the framework for Fyform because of the out-of-box features and 
                    ]structure of the application. It allows me to quickly learn how to develop software. With 
                    Rails, I can utilize ActiveStorage, ActiveJob, and ActiveMailer in combination with Sidekiq to 
                    process jobs. To solve Fyform auto-filling pdf from online forms, we utilized Appeligentâ€™s FDF 
                    to PDF API.  Due to font issues with PDF forms, we switched from Heroku to Digital Ocean.  
                    We are currently in the process of migrating back to Heroku because the font issue has been resolved.

                  <p>Tea Cozy is a portfolio project to showcase html/css. This was a project from Codeacademy, 
                    we were given a design mock up with stock images. How we coded the webpage was up to each 
                    individual.</p>
                  <h5>Technology</h5>
                  <p>Since it was a static webpage, I used basic HTML and CSS create the webpage.</p>
